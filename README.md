This is my final project for CS 441: Introduction to Computer Graphics.
My goal is to implement a ray tracer in C, and be able to render the
following:

- Spheres,
- mirrors,
- glass objects,
- multiple light sources,
- shadows,
- etc.

My minimum goal is to create a scene with a checkerboard plane as the
floor, and to render either a glass sphere or a mirrored sphere.
